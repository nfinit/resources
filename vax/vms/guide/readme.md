VAX/VMS Survival Guide
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This VAX/VMS "survival guide" is a roughly organized collection of working notes
based on my personal experiments with various small VMS 5/6-era VAX systems.
These notes cover some common tasks such as installing VMS, installing and
licensing software, administrating VMS systems and applications and some
development, and may hopefully be of use to other novice VAX users in the
modern era.
